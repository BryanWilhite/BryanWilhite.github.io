## the conventional [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repo 📜

Hello, this is Bryan Wilhite from the [Songhay System](http://songhaysystem.com/).

This HTML page is generated from the conventional, `README.md` file via `pandoc` [[🔗](https://pandoc.org/)] which is installed locally. The `pandoc` command is preserved as an NPM script in the `package.json` [file](./package.json) of this repo. I find this minimalism refreshing 🐇🕳
